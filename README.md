# Photogallery
This is a simple photo gallery with basic CMS - my academic project completed in 2013 while studying at Warsaw School of Computer Science (Warszawska Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki).

Depending on user Role there are different options available.
For example: logged USER can only add and delete pictures, but ADMIN has more "power" so that he can add/delete/modify users, news and pictures.

Used "Lightbox" plugin to display pictures.

You're welcome to check how it works:
ADMIN  -  login: admin,  password: adminadmin
USER   -  login: test1,  password: test1test1

Please note: starting page is StronaGlowna.aspx (just for purpose of this project).
